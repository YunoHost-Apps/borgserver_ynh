Setup a storage space to be used for backup using Borg

This app is the "server" part, meant to be installed on the machine providing the backup storage. It is designed to work in combination with the [borg 'client' app](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/borg) installed on a different machine. It can also be used to provide backup storage to another (non-yunohost) computer that is running a Borg client (ex: Pika Backup)
